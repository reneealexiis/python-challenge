## script creation 
I used XPert Learning Assistant to create a script to analyze the data set and output the requested information, in the requested format. I revised the script in Visual Studio Code as needed to ensure it's running correctly and with no errors. The output matches the examples provided in the assignment. 

### analysis of findings
PyBank: Over the span of the combined 86 months of data, you can conclude that the average change is ($8,311.11). You may also see the greatest increase vs. decrease of each budget. There is not enough information provided to create a specific analysis and/or recommendations. 

PyPoll: This data set provides a full list of candidates who received votes. From this dataset we can conclude the winner is Diana DeGette. It also shows the percentage of votes per candidate.
