# Project Overview 

In this project I was provided the financial records of a specific company. 
Using Python scripts, I created a script to analyze the data and calculate the net total amount of profit/losses over an entire period, the changes in profit/losses over the entire period along with an average of those changes, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the specified period. 

On this same project, I was given a set of poll data and using Python scripts I was able to identify the following: 
-	Total number of votes casted, complete list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes per candidate, total number of votes per candidate and the winner of the election based on popular vote. 


## script creation 
I used XPert Learning Assistant to create a script to analyze the data set and output the requested information, in the requested format. I revised the script in Visual Studio Code as needed to ensure it's running correctly and with no errors. The output matches the examples provided in the assignment. 

### analysis of findings
PyBank: Over the span of the combined 86 months of data, you can conclude that the average change is ($8,311.11). You may also see the greatest increase vs. decrease of each budget. There is not enough information provided to create a specific analysis and/or recommendations. 

PyPoll: This data set provides a full list of candidates who received votes. From this dataset we can conclude the winner is Diana DeGette. It also shows the percentage of votes per candidate.
